## REFLECTION

The group project was a valuable learning experience for me, as it helped me improve my communication skills within a team and taught me how to approach projects more effectively. I learned that it's important to always notify your group when you push changes to the master or main branch. This keeps everyone informed and allows them to pull the latest code before starting their own tasks, which helps reduce the risk of merge conflicts.

Additionally, commit messages should be detailed. It's important to communicate any changes, bugs, logic errors, or anything else that might affect the project. However, to avoid writing long commit messages, it’s often better to commit after completing a full feature or tweak—for example, a sidebar. Since I handled much of the CSS, I consistently asked for feedback to ensure alignment with the team.

Before diving into coding, we first met to discuss how we would design our Pinterest clone. In other words, we outlined the core features to implement, features to exclude, and optional features to work on if time allowed. We categorized the excluded and minor features based on their complexity and relevance to the overall project. Given our time constraints, identifying the most important elements was essential.

I believe that planning ahead helped us tremendously. It reduced the time spent on deciding what to do and allowed us to focus more on coding. Ideally, the plan should clearly outline which features to implement. Of course, no plan is perfect—we ended up adding and removing items as we progressed. As one of my professors once said, software development (among other things) is an iterative process.

Lastly, I learned a lot about backend development. At first the process was confusing because I wasn't sure how it connects to the frontend. By the end though I was coding some small controller functions.
