    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi, I'm John Tatlonghari (TAT-LONG-HARI), a junior Computer Science major at San Francisco State University. I have coding background in Java and recently started learning C++. Back in my elementary days, we were taught how to write HTML and CSS so hopefully that will help me during my time in CSC317. 
        Some of my hobbies include hiking, stargazing, video games, baking, and cooking. Making sourdough bread and pan seared salmon is my specialty, although I'm just a beginner.
