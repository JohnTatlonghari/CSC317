    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 
        Hi, I'm John Tatlonghari (TAT-LONG-HARI), a junior Computer Science major at San Francisco State University. I am a decent programmer in Java and just recently started to learn C++. 
    <br>Right now, my career goal is to get an internship to gain relevant experience. I do not have an idea of what area to specialize in yet but I have considered AI, Data, and UI/UX Design.
    <br>I hope to create a web-based image viewer once I finish this class. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        Some of my hobbies are hiking, stargazing, video games, baking, and cooking. I am currently learning how to make better sourdough bread and learning more sauces for my pan seared salmon.
