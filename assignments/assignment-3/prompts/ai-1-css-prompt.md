PROMPTS (Note that this also includes the feedback after the initial prompt)

Initial Prompt: can you style my website using gray for the body and white for header elements. make sure that the text can still be seen. Use a different font for headers. Center the logo and nav.
 
Feedback:

the background for footer is too dark and the footer link color doesn't contrast well with the background
can you increase the gap between links in the footer
can you put borders on the table grid?
is this style mobile friendly?
can you change the color text for  h1, h2,h3 that still contrasts with the background. slightly darken header bg color too
reduce saturation of h1,h2,h3 color
