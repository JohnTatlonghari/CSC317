# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
[Write a 250-500 word analysis comparing the different approaches]

My objective when approaching the handwritten CSS was that I wanted to keep the sections simple and organized. I had to keep adding/removing sections in index.html to make the styling easier. Most of my time was spent trying to style a section that didn't apply what I put, checking how the sectioning works, and redoing it. Sometimes I still can't tell whether to style the parent, the child, or go to the element itself. 

My first approach was to color the background and set the text color for the heading and paragraph. I decided to keep consistent with the color scheme of SF State. Recruiters generally look at skills more so each skill has a darker background which makes it stand out. The same thing applies for projects but since the only idea that I had at the time was that I wanted them in a grid, I went ahead and copied from example class code that had the grid display. When I complete more projects I can simply copy the "project-card" section which will add another grid square. That's all for my handwritten CSS.

Moving on, the AI code looks cleaner than my handwritten one. It felt easier to get chatGPT to achieve my vision because all I had to do was tell them what I want the website to look like. If it doesn't satisfy my conditions, I try to correct its code. Rinse and repeat. 

For the first AI style I had it reference an early draft of my style sheet and told chatGPT to use it as a reference. Then, I prompted for a neat and simple look that had good contrast. The AI came up with the gold-color heading and thought it looked nice so I kept it. 

I started the 2nd AI prompt by looking for portfolio websites (see ref.txt). The 2nd link, which I used for reference, happens to be the portfolio site of a web designer (presumed). Having chatGPT copy the screenshot I provided 1-1 was unsuccessful on the first couple tries so I had to upload my index file and specify which elements to style. I really liked the idea of having a different background color for the heading but I realize that might be more complicated to implement so I took whatever color chatGPT assigned it and changed it myself. Hopefully that doesn't count as modifying the AI CSS. 



## Lessons Learned
[Discuss what you learned from this exercise]

I learned that you should write html sections with the styling you have in mind. 
I have to ask things like: "is this going to be a flexbox? a grid?" or "should this heading element be in a separate section/div/article so I can style it differently later?"
In other words, planning ahead with the website layout and implementing them properly so that there are no bugs in the CSS is key. 

I also learned that you have almost all the CSS tools you need to create a good, interactive website. You have tools for layout, background, font, animation, forms, hovering, highlighting, and more.


## Preferred Version
[Explain which version you prefer and why]

I prefer the hybrid version more since I was able to integrate my own style and having a better "canvas" to work with. To me the result is much more polished than both Ai-2 and my own style.
