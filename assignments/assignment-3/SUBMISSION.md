# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
[Write a 250-500 word analysis comparing the different approaches]

## Lessons Learned
[Discuss what you learned from this exercise]
I learned that you should write html sections with the styling you have in mind. 
I have to ask things like: "is this going to be a flexbox? a grid?" or "should this heading element be in a separate section/div/article so I can style it differently later?"
In other words, planning ahead with the website layout and implementing them properly so that there are no bugs in the CSS is key. 

I also learned that you have almost all the CSS tools you need to create a good, interactive website. You have tools for layout, background, font, animation, forms, hovering, highlighting, and more.
